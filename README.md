**Arusha** is a generic authentication service for **Omnijar** projects. It's an 
implementation-agnostic service, designed to run without any opinions on the type
of solution that may use it. 

## History

Originally written in 2015, **Arusha** has since taken on significant changes twice,
with the current codebase a reduction effort on the original 2015 code, and the brief
attempt at re-writing in 2017 removed entirely.

Although the original project including [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) 
and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) features, the complexity
in maintaining these features as a side-project was a huge undertaking, when existing
solutions provided these features to an industry recognised standard.

## Origin

**Arusha** is a city in northern Tanzania, well known for its relatively high
impact on global rights and protections.
